This project focuses on classifying chest X-ray images into two main categories: healthy and pneumonia cases. Pneumonia cases are further divided into two subcategories: bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia.

The dataset used for training is sourced from Kaggle, comprising 5863 chest X-ray images categorized into the aforementioned groups.

Project Tasks:

Classification with Deep Learning: Implement a neural network to classify images into healthy and diseased categories. Additionally, implement a network with three outputs to classify into healthy, viral pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia categories.

Image Classification with Embedding and KNN: Showcase how a new image can be classified using the embedding vector generated from the classification network and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors). Visualize the different classes using t-SNE.

Transfer Learning with Imbalanced Training Data: Address the problem of imbalanced training data by changing the training and validation sets. Specifically, use a smaller training set to train the model and the original validation set for testing.

Anomaly Detection for Healthy Cases: Given a dataset comprising only "healthy" images, implement anomaly detection techniques to identify "unhealthy" cases.
